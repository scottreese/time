# Time
Sample socket.io app which shows the current time.

## Requirements
This app assumes you already have Node.js installed on your local machine. If you do not, I recommend using homebrew and nvm to get up and running quickly. The steps using homebrew and nvm are as follows:

1. `brew install nvm`
2. `nvm install 18`
3. `nvm use 18`

## Installation
1. Clone the repo to your local machine.
2. CD into the app directory and run `npm install` (e.g. `cd time && npm install`).
3. Start it up!: `npm start`
4. Visit http://localhost:8080 in your web browser to view the app.
